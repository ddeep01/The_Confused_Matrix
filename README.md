Personalized Youtube Video Engagement and Optimal Duration Prediction

Our project demonstrates a machine learning system capable of predicting
YouTube video engagement and recommending optimal video durations.
Using a dataset of over 50,000 videos, multiple models were evaluated,
and Gradient Boosting was selected as the best-performing model,
providing low MAE and strong generalization with minimal R² difference
between training and test sets.
